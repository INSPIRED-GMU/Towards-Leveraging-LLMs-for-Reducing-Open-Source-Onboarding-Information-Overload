How to Help Out
Before You Share Your Work:
Make sure you've looked at the rules for contributing.
Be familiar with the Code of Conduct.
 Sign the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This shows your changes follow our rules.
Make sure your changes match our coding style and guidelines.
 Run tests to check your work.
Sharing Your Code:
If you've got something to improve TensorFlow, we're excited to see it! Follow these steps:
If you're the only person who owns the work, sign an individual CLA here:((link).
If a company owns the work, sign a company CLA here: (link).
Use this guide to send your work to us using pull requests (link).
Finding Something to Work On:
Start by looking at issues labeled "good first issue" here (link). If you find something interesting, comment that you're working on it to let others know.
Making Sure Your Work Fits In Tests:
Add tests for new features to show they work and to keep them working in the future.
Bug fixes should include tests too, to prove they fix the issue.
Licensing:
Put the right license at the top of new files. Examples:
C/C++: Example (link)
 Python: Example (link)
And so on for other languages like Java, Go, Bash, HTML, JavaScript/TypeScript.
Coding Style:
Follow the coding style guidelines for each language. For example:
C++ changes should follow the Google C++ Style Guide (link).
Python changes should match the Google Python Style Guide (link).
Running Tests:
You can run tests directly if you have the right tools installed, or use Docker images for a simpler setup.
For detailed instructions, check here for CPU tests (link) and here for GPU tests (link).
Testing Doc Changes:
To test documentation changes, use `tf_doctest.py` with the file you changed. Install the latest `tf-nightly` to make sure you're testing the most recent changes.
Debugging:
 To debug C++ code, build TensorFlow with the `--config=dbg` option for debugging information. This helps when using debuggers like GDB.
