Here's how you can help improve Godot, a popular game engine. Whether you're finding bugs, suggesting new features, writing code, helping with translations, or talking to the developers, your contribution is welcome.

Quick Guide to Contributing
Finding and Reporting Bugs
One Bug Per Issue:Please report one bug per issue. If you've found multiple bugs, open an issue for each.
Search Before Reporting:  Your issue might already be reported. Check the issue tracker (link)first.
Give Details: Mention your operating system, Godot version, device, and graphics info. Clearly describe the steps to reproduce the bug.
Use Examples:If possible, attach a simple project file that shows the bug. This helps us fix it faster.
Suggesting Features
Where to Suggest:We use a separate repository for feature proposals (link). Check the instructions there to make your suggestion.
Be Clear and Detailed: Well-thought-out proposals are more likely to be considered.
Contributing Code
Is It Wanted?:Ensure the feature you're adding or the bug you're fixing is something the community needs.
Discuss First: It's a good idea to talk about what you're planning to do with the developers first, especially for big changes.
Add Tests and Docs: Include tests for bugs or new features. Update the documentation for any new features or changes to Godot's behavior.
Keep Git History Clean: Make focused pull requests on one topic, rebase your fork to avoid merge commits, and squash your commits if they fix issues in previous ones in the same PR.
Commit Messages Matter:Write readable commit messages with a concise title. Detail what your commit does and why.
Helping with Translations
Godot's Translations: You can help translate Godot and its documentation on Hosted Weblate(link). Check the translation readme (link) for more info.
Talking to Developers
Join the Chat: The Godot Contributors Chat (link) is where you can talk directly to the core team.
Use the Bug Tracker:Comment on existing issues or open a new one if you have a specific development topic in mind.
Feature Proposals:Have a feature idea? The feature proposals tracker (link) is the place to share it. Chatting with contributors first can help refine your idea.
Thanks for Helping!
