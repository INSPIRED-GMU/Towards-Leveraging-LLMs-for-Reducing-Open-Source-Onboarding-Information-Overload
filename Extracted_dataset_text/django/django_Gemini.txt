Helping Django!

Django loves your help! Here are some ways you can contribute:

Fix typos or mistakes in the code (code patches).
Improve the instructions (documentation).
Report bugs you find.
Review other people's bug reports and code fixes (patch reviews).

For more details, look here: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/)

Important!

To report bugs or suggest changes, write a ticket first.
Django uses a system called Trac to track issues because it works better for their community than GitHub.
You can still submit your code changes as pull requests, but they might get missed if you don't also make a ticket.

Be Nice!

Please read and follow the Django Code of Conduct to help keep the community welcoming to everyone.
