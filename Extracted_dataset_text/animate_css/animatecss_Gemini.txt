Helping Animate.css
Thanks for wanting to help make Animate.css even better! Before you get started, take a look at these guidelines. It's important to keep Animate.css high quality because many people use it.
Animation Ideas
Animations can be tricky because everyone has different tastes. These guidelines will help you suggest good animations for Animate.css:
Keep it simple: Don't make animations move too far or last too long (more than 1 second).
Don't be annoying: People shouldn't get tired of seeing the animations.
Don't mess with the page: Animations shouldn't make it harder to use the page (like hiding buttons).
Help people: Animations should make it easier for people to understand the page.
Fit in: Animations should feel like they belong with the other animations in Animate.css
Look natural: Animations should move like things do in real life (avoid jerky movements).
Code Stuff
Names for animations should be short words put together (like bounceIn).
Use two spaces to indent each line.
Leave a blank line at the end of each file.
Set up your code editor so it automatically formats the code correctly.
