Helping  Out with Animate.css
Thanks for wanting to help with Animate.css! Please keep these simple rules in mind to make sure Animate.css stays useful and high-quality for everyone.
Design Rules
When creating animations, try to follow these simple ideas:
Be Subtle:Keep animations small and short, ideally under 1 second.
Be Tolerable: Make sure animations aren’t annoying, even if seen many times.
Don't Mess Things Up: Animations shouldn’t make the website harder to use. They should be extra touches that don’t mess with the page's normal function.
Be Helpful: Use animations to guide users, make reading easier, or show how things are connected.
Fit In: Your animations should look like they belong with the others.
Look Real: Try to make animations mimic real-life physics as much as possible.
Writing Code
Here are some tips on how to write your code:
1. Name Things Right: Use camelCase and group names (like fades, bounces).
2. Indent Properly: Use two spaces for indenting.
3. Finish with Space: End files with a blank line.
4. Auto-Format: Use an editor config plugin/extension in your editor to make sure your code looks right automatically.
How to Make Your Contribution
1. Start by Forking: Make your own copy of the project.
2. Create a Branch: Make a new branch for your changes in your version.
   git checkout -b myNewFeature
3. Share Your Branch:** Upload your branch to your version of the project.
   git push origin myNewFeature 
4. Show a Demo: Make a pen (like on CodePen) to show what your change does.
5. Ask for a Merge:Open a Pull Request to the main project, with a clear title and description of what your change does.
That's it! Just keep things simple, clear, and thoughtful for others. Thanks for contributing!
