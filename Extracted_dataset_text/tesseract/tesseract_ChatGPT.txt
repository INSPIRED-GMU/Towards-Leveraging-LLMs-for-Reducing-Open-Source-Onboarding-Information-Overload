Asking for Help or Reporting Problems
If You Find a Bug:
Create an issue: if you think there's a bug.
Use the user forum here (link) for help with using Tesseract, installation problems, OCR accuracy questions, training questions, or any general questions. 
Check the Improve Quality documentation (link) and the official training guides (link) before asking about improving OCR accuracy or training.
When to Report an Issue:
Only for Linux (not older than 4 years), Windows (Windows 7 or newer), or macOS (last 3 releases).
For other systems or older versions, use the forum.
Mention your operating system and its version when you report an issue.
Look through existing issues first to see if someone else has reported the same problem.
Only report issues for the latest official release. You can also check if your issue is fixed in the latest development version.
Before Reporting an Issue:
Make sure the problem happens with the Tesseract command line program.
If you're using Tesseract through another program or wrapper, contact the developers of that software.
You need the trained data for English (eng) and OSD. Check that Tesseract can find these files with a command.
Sharing Files and Errors:
Share example files to show the problem but don't share private information.
Files should be less than 20 MB. If bigger, share a zip file or a link to download them.
Share error messages by copying and pasting them. Use three backticks (\`\`\`) to format command outputs or code samples.
Be Nice:
Remember, most people helping out are volunteers or other users. Be polite and understanding.
For Tesseract Development Discussion:
Use the tesseract developers forum (link) for talks on bug fixes, improvements, or add-ons.

For Developers: Sharing Your Changes
Before Sharing:
Make sure your changes work.
Include all necessary submodules (like `googletest`, `test`). 

Use `git submodule update --init recursive` for each submodule needed.
Check the README, testing instructions, and installation documentation (link).

Making a Pull Request:
Build the library and command-line interface with `make`.
Test it with `make check`.
Build the training tools with `make training`.
If everything works, push your changes to a new branch in your fork of Tesseract on GitHub, then make a pull request. Hereâ€™s how: Creating a pull request from a fork (link).

Keep an eye on automated build statuses and quality scans. If they show your changes made things worse, you might need to fix those issues.
