Contributing to scikit-learn
The latest contributing guide is available in the repository at  doc/developers/contributing.rst, or online at:(link)
There are many ways to contribute to scikit-learn, with the most common ones being contribution of code or
documentation to the project. Improving the documentation is no less important than improving the library itself. If you find a typo in the documentation, or have made improvements, do not hesitate to send an email to the mailing list or preferably submit a GitHub pull request. Documentation can be found under the doc (link) directory.
But there are many other ways to help. In particular answering queries on the issue tracker (link), investigating bugs, and reviewing other developers' pull requests (link) are very valuable contributions that decrease the burden on the project maintainers.
Another way to contribute is to report issues you're facing, and give a "thumbs up" on issues that others reported
and that are relevant to you. It also helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles, link to it from your website, or simply star it in GitHub to say "I use it".
