Helping AngularJS
We'd love your help to improve AngularJS! Here's how you can get involved:
How to ask questions
Instead of asking on GitHub, ask your questions on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/angularjs) because:
Many people can help you there.
Answers are public so others can benefit.
The best answers get the most attention.
We will close questions asking for general help and point you here.
How to report bugs:
If you find a bug, report it (create an issue) on GitHub. You can also fix it yourself and submit a pull request.
How to request features:
You can request new features by creating an issue on GitHub.
Discuss bigger changes in an issue first.
Small changes can be submitted as a pull request directly.
How to improve the documentation:
Let us know if you have ideas to improve the documentation by creating an issue.
You can also fix typos or small mistakes yourself using the "Improve this doc" button.
For bigger changes, let others know what you're working on first and test your changes before submitting a pull request.
Submitting issues:
Before creating a new issue, search to see if someone already asked the same question.
If you find a bug that hasn't been reported before, create a new issue with details including:
What the problem is
Why it's a problem for you
Which version of AngularJS you're using
What browsers and operating systems are affected (if applicable)
Steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable)
Any related issues
Ideas on how to fix the bug (if you have any)
Submitting pull requests:
Before submitting a pull request, search GitHub to see if someone else already submitted something similar.
Create a new branch to work on your changes. You can do this with the following command:
git checkout -b my-fix-branch master
Include tests with your changes.
Make sure all tests pass before submitting your pull request.
Write a clear description for your changes following our guidelines.
Commit your changes using a descriptive message. You can do this with the following command:
git commit -a
Submit your pull request to GitHub.
Once you submit your pull request, a system will automatically check your code and test it.
If there are any problems, you'll be notified.
If we ask you to make changes, make the changes and update your pull request. You can do this with the following commands:
git rebase master -i
git push origin my-fix-branch -f
That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
After your pull request is merged
You can delete your branch and update your local copy with the latest changes. Here are the commands to do that:
git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
git checkout master -f
git branch -D my-fix-branch
git pull --ff upstream master
Signing an agreement
When you submit a pull request, you'll be asked to sign an agreement. This is a quick process. â–‘
