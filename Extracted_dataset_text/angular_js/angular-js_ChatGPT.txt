Helping Out with AngularJS
We're really excited that you're interested in helping make AngularJS even better! Here's a simple guide on how you can contribute:
Be Nice: It's important to us that everyone feels welcome. Please read and follow our kindness rules.
Have a Question or Found a Problem? Stack Overflow is the best place to ask questions. For bugs or feature ideas, tell us on GitHub.
Improving the Docs? Your suggestions are welcome! You can either tell us what to fix or fix it yourself.
Before Sending Your Changes: Please make sure you agree to our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
Code of Conduct
Help us keep AngularJS welcoming. Please follow our Code of Conduct.
Questions, Bugs, and Features
Got a Question?
For questions, Stack Overflow is your friend. We keep GitHub for bugs and feature requests.
Stack Overflow is great because:
Many people are there to help.
Questions and answers help others too.
The best answers are easy to find.
Found a Bug?
If you spot a bug in the code, tell us on GitHub. Better yet, you can fix it and submit a Pull Request.
For issues with localization: AngularJS uses the Google Closure I18N library, so any changes should be directed to the Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) project or the Closure guide.
Missing a Feature?
 Feel free to ask for new features on GitHub.
Big ideas should be discussed first; small changes can be directly submitted.
Want to Help with Docs?
For small tweaks, just go ahead. For bigger changes, let us know to avoid duplicate work.
Use the "Improve this doc" button for quick edits.
Test your changes if they're big, and follow our guidelines for commit messages.
Submitting Issues and Pull Requests
Before Submitting an Issue:
Look through existing issues to avoid duplicates.
Provide as much info as possible to help us understand:
What went wrong?
Why is this a problem for you?
Which version of AngularJS are you using?
Does this happen in all browsers?
Can you show us the error (with a live example or steps to reproduce)?
Making a Pull Request:
1. Look for similar Pull Requests first.
2. Start by creating a new branch for your fixes:

   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master

3. Make your changes, including tests. Follow our coding rules.
4. Run the tests to make sure everything's still working.
5. Commit your changes with a clear message:

   git commit -a

6. Before sending it to us, run all tests one more time:

   yarn grunt test

7. Push your branch and create the Pull Request on GitHub.
After Your Pull Request is Merged:
You can delete your branch:

  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
 
Update your master branch with the latest from upstream:
  git checkout master -f
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  git pull --ff upstream master

Signing the CLA
When you make a Pull Request, a bot will ask you to sign our CLA if you haven't already. This is quick and necessary even for docs.
Individuals can use a simple online form. Companies need to send a signed form.
Thanks for contributing to AngularJS!
