How to Help with Ruby on Rails

Found a Bug?
For security bugs, don't post on GitHub. Go here instead: Rails Security (link).
Already reported?  Search Rails Issues (link) to see if it's already there.
New bug? If you can't find it, post a new issue here (link). Include a good title, clear description, lots of details, and a code sample or test showing what should happen but isn't.

Made a Fix?
Got a fix? Awesome! Make a new pull request (PR) with your patch.
Describe it well** in the PR. If it's related to an issue, mention that issue number.

Just Styling or Formatting?
Cosmetic changes might not get accepted. We're looking for things that make Rails more stable, functional, or testable.

Adding or Changing Features?
1. Propose it first in the rubyonrails-core mailing list (link).
2. Wait for feedback before making a GitHub issue. Issues are mainly for bugs and fixes.
