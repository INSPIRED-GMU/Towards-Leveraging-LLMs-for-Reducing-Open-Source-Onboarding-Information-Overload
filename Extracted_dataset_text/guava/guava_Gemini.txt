Simplified Guide to Contributing to Guava

We appreciate your interest in helping Guava! Here's a basic idea of how to get involved:

Adding New Features (APIs):

Talk about it first! New features require careful discussion. Create a new issue on GitHub explaining what you'd like to see and why it's useful. 
If the idea is accepted, we'll discuss how to design the feature before any coding starts.

Fixing Bugs or Making Improvements:

Small fixes (like typos) are welcome as pull requests.
For bigger changes, it's good to create an issue first, even for minor things. This helps keep everyone on the same page. 
Here are some examples of helpful pull requests:
Fixing bugs without changing anything users see (public APIs).
Improving Guava's documentation. 
 Making Guava's build system (Maven) better.

Code Contribution Rules:

Big changes should have tests to make sure they work correctly. 
Your code needs to follow specific formatting rules (see Google's Java Style Guide). 
All code must be licensed under Apache 2.0.
Combine your changes into one commit before submitting your pull request.
Write a clear and concise message explaining your changes.

Merging Your Contribution:

Guava's code is also used internally by Google. Because of this, we can't directly merge pull requests into the main Guava branch.
Instead, if your contribution is accepted, we'll make the changes internally and credit you in the commit.

Contributor License Agreement (CLA):

To contribute to Guava, you need to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA). This basically says Google can use your code as part of Guava. 
There are two types of CLAs: one for individuals and one for companies.
You can find the CLAs and more info on Google's open-source website. 
You usually only need to sign a CLA once for all Google projects.
