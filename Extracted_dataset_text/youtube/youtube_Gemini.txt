contributing to Youtube-dl involves following these guidelines:
Reporting Issues:
Include the complete output (`-v` flag) when reporting a bug.
Search for existing issues before opening a new one.
Clearly explain the problem, how to fix it if possible, and why existing options are insufficient.
If the issue involves multiple problems, report them separately.
Only report features you personally require.
Make sure you're using Youtube-dl and not a UI for it.
Contributing Code:
Ensure the site distributes content legally.
Follow these steps to add support for a new site called "yourextractor":
1. Fork the repository and clone it locally.
  2. Create a new branch for your extractor.
  3. Start with a template and save it as `youtube_dl/extractor/yourextractor.py`. This file includes functions to extract video ID, title, description, etc. from the webpage.
  4. Add an import for your extractor in `youtube_dl/extractor/extractors.py`.
  5. Run tests to validate your code.
  6. Refer to `youtube_dl/extractor/common.py` for helper methods and expected information in 	the information dictionary.
  7. Ensure your code follows Youtube-dl coding conventions (flake8).
  8. Make sure your code works under all supported Python versions.
  9. Commit and push your changes.
  10. Create a pull request for your changes to be reviewed and merged.
Coding Conventions:
Extractors are sensitive to website layout changes, so prioritize code that minimizes layout dependency and anticipates future changes.
Information dictionaries should include mandatory fields like `id` (media identifier), `title` (media title), and `url` (media download URL). 
Provide fallback options when extracting optional metadata from multiple sources. 
Use regular expressions thoughtfully: avoid capturing unnecessary groups, make them flexible, and keep them under 80 characters per line.
Extract numeric data using convenience functions from `youtube_dl/utils.py`.
These are the core guidelines for contributing to Youtube-dl! Remember, clear communication, well-structured code, and adherence to conventions are key to a successful contribution.
