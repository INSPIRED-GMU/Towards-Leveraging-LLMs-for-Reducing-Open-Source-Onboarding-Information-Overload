How to Contribute to Spring Framework
Quick Start
Ask Questions: Use Stack Overflow (link) for help.
Find or Report Issues: Check GitHub issues (link) for similar reports or create a new one.
Pull Requests: For contributing code, directly submit a pull request (PR) to our GitHub repository.

Code of Conduct:
Please follow our Code of Conduct (link). 
Report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.
Creating Issues
Research First: Look for existing issues or discussions on Stack Overflow.
Report with Details: If you’re reporting a bug or requesting a feature, provide detailed steps or a description. Use a Minimal Reproducible Example (link) when possible.

Pull Requests (PR)
1. License Agreement: Sign the Contributor License Agreement (link) if you haven't already.
2. Issue First?: No need to create an issue first, describe your changes well in the PR itself.
3. Target Branch: Submit PRs against the `main` branch. For specific versions, check `settings.gradle`.
4. Commit Messages: Keep them clear. Use a concise 55 character summary, detail within 72 characters per line, and reference issues fixed.
5. Prior Issues: Reference any related GitHub issue numbers in your PR.
6. Reviews: Contributions may be modified before merging. You may be asked to make changes—just push them to the same branch.

Reviews and Building from Source
Participate in Reviews: Feel free to review other PRs, but leave approval to core committers.
Build Instructions: See Build from Source (link) for how to build and import Spring Framework source code.

Style Guides and Docs:
Follow our Code Style (link) guidelines.
Reference documentation is under `src/docs/asciidoc`. 
Use Asciidoctor for changes and check with `./gradlew asciidoctor`.
