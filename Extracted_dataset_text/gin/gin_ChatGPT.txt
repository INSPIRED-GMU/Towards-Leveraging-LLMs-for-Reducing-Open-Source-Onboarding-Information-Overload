Helping Out
If You Find a Problem:
Before you report a new problem, please use the search to make sure it hasn’t been reported already.
If you’re reporting a bug, please include the source code and the specific commit (commit sha) where you found the bug.
Look at the problems others have reported. You can give more information on these problems or just show your support for fixing them.

If You’re Adding Changes:
When you want to add something new, make your changes in the main part of the project (master).
Your changes should be in no more than two updates (commits). If there are more, you need to combine them (squash them).
Make sure your changes don’t break anything by passing all the checks in systems like GitHub Actions.
Include or update tests to make sure your changes work well.
If you’re adding a new feature, please explain it in the README so everyone knows how it works.
