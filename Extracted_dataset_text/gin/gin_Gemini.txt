Contributing to Flutter in a Snap

Helping with Issues:

Search before creating a new issue to avoid duplicates.
If you find a bug, include code and a special code number (commit sha) if you have them.
Read other issues and add comments or thumbs up/down.

Sending Code Changes (Pull Requests):

Submit your changes to the "master" branch.
Combine your changes into 2 changes or less.
Your code must pass all the tests (like on GitHub Actions).
Add new tests for your code changes.
If your code adds a new feature, update the README file to explain it.
