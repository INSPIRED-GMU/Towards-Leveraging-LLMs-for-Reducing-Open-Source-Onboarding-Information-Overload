For feature ideas, first open an issue on our GitHub to discuss.
How to Submit Your Work:
Issues: Before submitting, search if the issue already exists here (link).
Pull Requests (PRs): 
  1. Search existing pulls (link) to avoid    duplication.
  2. Discuss major changes in issues before working.
  3. Fork the repo and create your branch.
  4. Make your changes and write a good commit message.
  5. Push your branch and submit a pull request on GitHub.
  6. If changes are suggested, update your PR as needed.

After Your PR is Merged:
After merging, you can delete your branch:
bash
git push origin --delete my-fix-branch

Update your local master branch:
bash
git checkout master
git pull --ff upstream master

Writing Good Commit Messages:
Keep them clear and simple.
Follow this format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`.
Types can be: `docs`, `feat`, `fix`.
Scope (optional) could be a specific part of the project you’re working on.
The subject should briefly describe the change.
Use the present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature".
Don’t end with a period.
The body should explain why and what changed, contrasting with previous behavior.
The footer can close issues: “Close #394”.
Thanks for contributing to RealWorld! Your efforts help make the project better for everyone.
