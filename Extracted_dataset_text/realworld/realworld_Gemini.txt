How to Help RealWorld
We want you to help make RealWorld even better! Here are some guidelines:
Read our rules (link) to keep things friendly.

Got a question?
Ask in the discussions (link) instead of creating an issue.

Thinking of a new feature for RealWorld?
Discuss it first (link) to avoid duplicate work. 
Small features can be submitted as a pull request right away. 
Big features need an issue submitted first to discuss it.

Found a bug?
Report it as an issue (link) with details. 
You can even fix it yourself and submit a pull request!

Submitting things:
 Before submitting anything, search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
Use the templates (link) when creating issues.
Submitting a pull request (fixing something or adding something new):
1. Check for existing pull requests that might be similar (link).
2. Make sure there's an issue describing what you're fixing or adding.
3. Copy the RealWorld code (link), make your changes in a new area of the code.
4. Follow the steps to commit your changes (updating the code).
5. Submit your changes as a pull request.

If we ask you to change your pull request:
Make the changes we ask for.
Update your code and submit it again.

After your pull request is merged:

You can delete your extra code and update your local copy with the latest changes.

How to write commit messages (updating code descriptions):
There's a specific way to write descriptions for your code changes. 
Keep the descriptions short and to the point (less than 100 characters).
There are three parts to a description: 
  Type of change (fix, feature, documentation)
Area of the code affected 
Short description of the change
You can also use the descriptions to mention issues you're fixing.

We hope this simplifies the information on how to contribute to RealWorld!
