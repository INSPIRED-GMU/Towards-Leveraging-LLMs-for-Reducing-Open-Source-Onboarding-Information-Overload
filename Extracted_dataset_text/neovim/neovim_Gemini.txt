Guide to contributing to Neovim:
Getting Started
Want to help Neovim but unsure where to begin? Here are some beginner-friendly tasks:
1. Find an issue labeled "complexity:low" link to good first issue is unavailable. These are simple problems you can fix.
2. Look for bugs reported by Clang, PVS or Coverity (automated bug finders).
3. Improve the documentation ([link to documentation is unavailable]).
Reporting Problems
Check the FAQ ([link to FAQ is unavailable]).
Search existing issues to avoid duplicates ([link to search issues is unavailable]).
Update Neovim to see if the problem persists.
Try to reproduce the problem with a clean Neovim setup (`nvim --clean`).
If you think it's a code issue, narrow down the cause by disabling plugins one by one.
For code issues, try to isolate the problem in the source code (`git bisect`).  
Include a stack trace when reporting crashes ([link to stack trace info is unavailable]).
Use ASAN/UBSAN for detailed error messages (related to memory).
Check Neovim's log file (`edit $NVIM_LOG_FILE`).  

For Developers
Read Neovim's developer help (`:help dev`, `:help dev-ui`, `:help dev-api-client`).
Install ninja for faster builds (`sudo apt-get install ninja-build`).

Pull Requests (PRs)

Create draft PRs to avoid duplicate work. 
Include tests for your changes (link). 
Avoid unrelated changes in the same commit.
Use a separate feature branch instead of modifying the main code (`master`).
Use a rebase workflow for small PRs. Rebasing allows you to combine commits into a cleaner history. (link)
Use a merge workflow for large or risky PRs. Merging integrates your changes with the main codebase. (link)
Don't edit commits that come before the merge commit.
During a squash/fixup, use `exec make -C build unittest` between each change you make.

PR Stages

Draft: Use this while you're still working on the PR.
Ready for review: When your PR is ready for feedback from others.

Commit Messages

Follow the recommended format to make reviewing easier. 
`<type>([optional scope]): <description>`  
Optional details can follow the description.
Use prefixes like `fix`, `feat`, `test` to describe the type of change (refer to full guide for details on prefixes).
Keep the first line concise (under 72 characters).
Use the imperative voice ("Fix bug" instead of "Fixed bug").
Mark breaking changes with `!` and a "BREAKING CHANGE" explanation.  

Automated Builds (CI)

Each PR must pass automated tests (https://github.com/topaxi/gh-actions.nvim).
Failing tests or compiler warnings will cause the build to fail.  
You can run some tests locally (`make test`).

Code Style

Run the linter to check your code for errors (`make lint`).
Neovim uses a specific coding style. Use `uncrustify` or `clang-format` to automatically format your code.

Reviewing

Review other people's PRs to help improve Neovim.
