Helping Create React App

Welcome! This guide will help you contribute to Create React App. Please read it carefully to make things smooth for everyone.

Our Goals

We want to make it easy for people to get started with React.
We avoid complex setups and flags whenever possible.
We use conventions and automatic features instead of configuration.

Examples

We always use `src/index.js` as the entry file.
We set the output file name automatically.
We use port 3000 for development by default, but can adjust for cloud environments.

Breaking the Rules

Sometimes, we add flags or configuration if it's really necessary. 
For example, we allow setting a homepage for non-root apps.

Submitting Improvements

Pull requests (code changes) are great!
Keep your changes focused on one thing.
Ask the developers if someone is already working on your idea.
Include a test plan to show your changes work.

Code Structure

Create React App uses separate packages for different parts. 
These packages are located in the `packages/` directory.

Setting Up a Local Copy

You need Node.js and Yarn to work on the code locally.
Clone the repo and run `npm install`.
You can then modify files and run commands like `npm start`.

Running Tests

Use `npm run e2e:docker` to run all tests.

Customizing Tests**

You can change how tests connect to private packages.

Tips for Windows Users

Use Bash on Windows to run the scripts easily.
Install Node.js and Yarn again using nvm.
Set Git line endings to LF to avoid errors.

Releasing a New Version**

1. Tag merged pull requests with the right labels.
2. Close the current release milestone and create a new one.
3. Update the version number for `react-scripts` (usually the only package that needs updating).
4. Be very careful when changing files in `packages/create-react-app`.
5. Update the changelog with all the changes and authors.
6. Publish the changes.
7. Create a release on GitHub with the changelog text.

Releasing the Documentation

1. Go to the `docusaurus/website` directory.
2. Run commands to build and deploy the documentation.

We hope this helps! Thanks for reading!
