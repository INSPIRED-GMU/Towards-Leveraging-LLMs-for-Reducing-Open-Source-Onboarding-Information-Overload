Helping Out with VS Code
Welcome! We're thrilled you're interested in helping with VS Code. There's more to contributing than just coding. Here's how you can get involved in different ways.

Asking Questions
Got a question? Post it on Stack Overflow (link) with the tag `vscode` instead of opening an issue here.

Giving Feedback
We welcome your thoughts and feedback! Check out our Feedback Channels (link) for where and how to let us know what you think.

Reporting Issues
Find the Right Spot: VS Code is big and spread out over many repos. Make sure you report your issue in the right place. If you're not sure, start here (link).
Check First: Look through current issues (link) to avoid duplicates. Also, look at the most popular feature requests (link).
React, Don't "+1":Found something that matches your issue? Use the 👍 reaction to vote it up instead of adding a "+1" comment.

Writing Good Reports
Keep it One Issue Per Report: Stick to one problem or request per report.
Be Detailed: More details help us fix issues faster. Use the issue reporting tool in VS Code (from the Help menu) for a head start. Include:
 Your VS Code version and OS
 Extensions you're using
Steps to recreate the issue
What you expected vs. what happened
Screenshots or videos if possible
A code snippet or repo link (code in images or gifs doesn't count)
Any errors from the Developer Tools Console (Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

Creating Pull Requests

Final Checklist
Before you submit, make sure to:
Search to ensure it's a new report
Try to recreate the issue with no extensions active
Keep your example code simple to help isolate the problem

Follow Your Issue
Once you've submitted, we have a workflow (link) to manage issues. Our bots help out but might close issues if they're inactive or need more info, so keep an eye on your notifications.
