Contributing to VS Code:

How to Help
Got a question? Ask on Stack Overflow tagged vscode instead of filing an issue ((link)
Want to share feedback? Use the channels listed here: (link)
Reporting Issues:
Found a bug or want a new feature? Report it as an issue on GitHub.
 Before reporting, check these things:
Is the issue in the right project? (See related projects list:(link))
Does the issue happen without any extensions? If so, report it to VS Code. If caused by an extension, report it to that extension's repo.
Has someone already reported it? Search existing issues first (link). 
Upvote existing issues you agree with instead of adding "+1" comments.
If you can't find your issue, report a new one with these details:
One issue per problem or feature request.
Version of VS Code, operating system, extensions you have installed.
Steps to reproduce the issue.
What you expected to see vs what you actually saw (screenshots or videos are helpful!).
Code snippet showing the issue (developers need to copy/paste this, so don't use images).
Any error messages from the Dev Tools Console.
