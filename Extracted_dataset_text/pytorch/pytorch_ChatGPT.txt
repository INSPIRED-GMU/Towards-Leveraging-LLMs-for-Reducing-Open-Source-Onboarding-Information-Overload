Contributing to PyTorch 

 How to Start Contributing:
1. Idea Sharing: Got a feature idea or a bug to fix? 
Start by discussing it in a GitHub issue at PyTorch's repository: (link).

2. Choosing an Issue: Want to contribute to existing tasks?
Search for an open issue here: (link).
Comment on the issue you're interested in to let others know you'll be working on it.

Setting Up Your Development Environment:
1. Remove Old Versions**: Ensure no older installations interfere.
   bash
   conda uninstall pytorch -y
   pip uninstall torch -y  # Repeat until it's fully uninstalled
   

2. Clone PyTorch:
   bash
   git clone (link)
   cd pytorch
   

3. Update Your Local Repository (if you've cloned it before):
   bash
   git pull --rebase
   git submodule sync --recursive
   git submodule update --init --recursive --jobs 0
   

4. Install PyTorch in Develop Mode:
  	This lets you make changes without reinstalling PyTorch.
   bash
   python setup.py develop
   

Testing and Debugging Your Changes:
  Run Python Unit Tests**:
  bash
  python test/run_test.py  # For the entire suite
  python test/test_specific_file.py  # For specific tests
  
  Run C++ Unit Tests** (after building PyTorch):
  bash
  ./build/bin/test_cpp_binary --gtest_filter=TestSuite.TestName
  

Documentation and Linting:
  Building Documentation: To build and check your documentation changes locally.
  bash
  cd docs/
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  make html
  
  Running Linters**: To ensure your code meets PyTorch's coding standards.
  bash
  make lint  # For all files
  make quicklint  # For changed files only
  
  Running clang-tidy**: For C++ code analysis and fixing.
  bash
  python3 -m tools.linter.install.clang_tidy
  make clang-tidy  # Check entire codebase
  make clang-tidy CHANGED_ONLY=--changed-only  # Check your changes
  Submitting Your Contributions:
Once you've implemented and tested your feature or bug fix, create a Pull Request (PR) to the main PyTorch repository.
Additional Tips:

Keep your local repository up to date with the main PyTorch repository.
Pay close attention to the feedback from Continuous Integration (CI) systems on your PRs.
For C++ development, consider using `ninja` for faster builds and `ccache` to avoid recompiling unchanged files.
For CUDA development, utilize `cuda-gdb` and `cuda-memcheck` for debugging.
