Helping fix AGC code

This document explains how to help fix the code for old computers called AGCs. 

About the code

The code was typed from paper copies, so there might be mistakes.
We need to fix the code to match these paper copies.
The paper copies are called "AGC printouts" for Comanche and Luminary.

Help from your computer programs

There are special programs you can add to your code editor to help you see the AGC code better. 
These programs are called "AGC language extensions".
Not all programs have these extensions, but some do like:  
      Atom
      CodeBlocks
      Visual Studio Code  
These programs with a â€  symbol can also automatically format the code for you.

How to format the code

Use the "tab" key to indent lines instead of spaces.
Make sure each tab is 8 spaces wide.
Get rid of any extra spaces at the end of lines.

What to check

Look for any differences between the paper copies and the code on the computer.

Comments in the code

The comments in the code MUST match the paper copies exactly, even if they seem wrong.

What mistakes to look for

Typos: Sometimes the people who wrote the code originally made typos in the comments. These typos might have been fixed or added when the code was typed from paper. 
Spaces: The number of spaces between words in the comments should match the paper copies. 
    Usually one space for new words.
    Usually two spaces for new sentences.
    Usually three spaces for indents.
    Not all the paper copies follow this rule, so copy the number of spaces you see.
Line breaks:
Lines that start with "R0000" in the first spot (column) must have line breaks exactly like the paper copies.
Lines that don't start with "R0000" in the first spot can only have one or two blank lines in a row. If there are more than two, get rid of the extra ones. Lines with "R0000" don't count.
Read more about line breaks in issue #159.

Before you submit your changes

Make sure your changes match the paper copies exactly!

Remember:
AGC = Old computer
Printouts = Paper copies
Extension = Special program for your code editor
Issue = Discussion about a problem
