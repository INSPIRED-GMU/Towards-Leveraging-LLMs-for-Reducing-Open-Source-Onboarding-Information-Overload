Helping to Improve jQuery
Here's a simple guide on how to get involved with making jQuery even better!
Finding Your Way Around:
This guide is for fixing the core code of jQuery, not plugins.
Report plugin bugs to the plugin author.
Report API documentation issues to the API repo(link).
Report bugs for other jQuery projects in their own repos (link).
How to Get Started:
There are ways to help beyond writing new features (which are rare).
You can help find bugs, write tests, or improve the documentation.
Learn more about contributing at (link).
This includes tips and tricks for getting started.
Be sure to review the guide on making commits and pull requests (link).
This will show you how to properly submit changes.
You'll need to sign an agreement before your changes can be accepted. You can preview it on GitHubs((link).
Got Questions? Here's Where to Ask:
Many people know jQuery well.
Check forums like Stack Overflow (link) first for answers.
The jQuery Core team follows the jQuery Development Forum (link).
Use this for longer discussions or questions that can't be answered on forums like Stack Overflow.
If you think you found a bug, report it officially (not on the forum).
The Core team can also be found in an online chat channel ((link).
They have weekly meetings to discuss progress (link).
Reporting Bugs:
Make sure it's actually a bug in jQuery, not your code.
Try getting help on forums first (link).
Disable browser extensions as they can sometimes cause issues.
Test with the latest version of jQuery (link).
Simplify the problem to the bare minimum to make it easier to fix.
Search for existing bug reports before submitting a new one (link).

Fixing Bugs (Patches):
We love people who fix bugs they find!
It takes time for changes to be reviewed and released because so many people use jQuery.
To fix bugs, you'll need to make a local copy of the jQuery code.
Instructions for this can be found in the full guide.
This includes running tests to make sure your fix doesn't break anything else.

Remember:
Always test your changes thoroughly before submitting them.
