How to Help with jQuery
Thanks for wanting to contribute to jQuery! Here's a simple guide to get you started.
Before You Start
This place is only for jQuery Core code development. For plugins, contact the plugin author. For API docs, report here (link). Other project issues go to their specific repos (link).

Getting Involved
 Learn: Understand our API design principles (link). We welcome help with bug finding, test writing, and documentation.
Contribute: If you have a new feature idea, make sure it fits our guidelines (link). For more on contributing, check (link). Don't forget to sign the Contributor License Agreement when making a pull request (link).

Questions and Discussion
Ask: Got a question? Try Stack Overflow (link) first. For longer discussions or specific queries about jQuery Core development, use our forum (link)or chat with us in IRC at #jquery-dev (link).
Meet: Join our weekly status meeting on IRC at #jquery-meeting (link).

How to Report Bugs
Check First: Many issues are actually caused by user code. Try asking for help on forums or Stack Overflow.
Disable Extensions**: Ensure the problem isn't caused by a browser extension by testing in a clean browser session.
Use the Latest jQuery**: Test with the latest version (link) to make sure it's still an issue.
Simplify: Reduce your code to the smallest example that still shows the problem. This helps us fix issues faster.
Search and Report: Look for similar issues in our tracker (link). If it's new, create an issue with all the details.

Tips for Bug Patching
Local Setup: Fork the repo (link) and set up your local environment. Run `$ npm run build` to build jQuery and open the test suite at `http://localhost/test`.
Test Suite: Use the test suite for your changes. You can run specific module tests to speed things up. Always run the full suite before finalizing your patch.
Watch Changes: Use `$ grunt watch` to automatically rebuild jQuery as you code, or load tests as ECMAScript modules directly on the test page for quicker testing.
Repo Organization: jQuery uses ECMAScript modules compiled at build time. Check the "src" folder to see how we organize code.

Remember
Your code must work across all supported browsers. Check the browser support page (link) for the full list.
