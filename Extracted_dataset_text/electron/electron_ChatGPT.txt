Contributing to Electron
üëçüéâ First, thank you for wanting to help! üéâüëç

We follow the Contributor Covenant code of conduct. By joining in, you're expected to follow this code. If you see behavior that's not acceptable, email us at coc@electronjs.org.

Here are some guidelines for contributing to Electron. They're not strict rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to suggest changes to this document in a pull request.

Issues
You can create issues here (link).

How to Help with Issues:
Asking for help
 Reporting a bug
Helping with a bug report
Fixing a bug report.

When We Close Issues:
If no one has added to an issue for a while and it's about a version we no longer support, we might close it. Electron keeps updating and supports the three latest major versions. We release a new major version every 8 weeks. Learn more about how we release versions (link).

If an issue is closed but you think it's still relevant, you can get our attention by commenting or reaching out to a maintainer.

Languages
We take issues in any language. If you write in a language other than English, it's good to also post an English translation. Anyone can translate; a quick use of translation software is often enough. Having both the original and the translation helps avoid misunderstandings.

Replies might be in English or the original language.

Using non-English to avoid our Code of Conduct may lead to a ban from the project.
