Add or Replace a Stream

make sure that the link you want to add works by using a program like VLC media player (link)check if the channel is working outside your country by using a VPN or use a service like streamtest.in (link) find out from which country the channel is being broadcasted. This information can usually be found on lyngsat.com (streamtest.in(link) or wikipedia.org (link). If you are unable to determine which country the channel belongs to, add the channel onto the channels/unsorted.m3u playlist find the corresponding ISO_3166-2 code (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) for the country open the /streams folder and find the file that has the same code in its name and open it if broken, find the broken link in this file and replace it with working one if new, at the very end of this file add a link to the channel with a description
if the broadcast is not available outside of a certain country, add the label [Geo-blocked] to the end of the channel name and list these countries in the tvg-country attribute if the broadcast is not available 24 hours a day, add the label [Not 24/7] commit all changes and send a pull request
