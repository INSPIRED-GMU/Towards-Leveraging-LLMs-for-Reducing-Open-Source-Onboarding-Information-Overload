Helping Out
We welcome and appreciate help from the community. When you help with axios, you need to follow our rules of conduct.
Code Style
Please use the node style guide for writing code.
Commit Messages
When you make changes, your commit messages should start with verbs like:
Fixing 
Adding 
Updating 
Removing 
Testing
If you change the code, you need to update the tests too. We can't accept changes if they don't pass tests on Travis CI.
Documentation
Make sure the documentation matches the actual code and its features.

Developing
Use these commands for different tasks:
`grunt test` to run jasmine and mocha tests
`grunt build` to bundle the source with webpack
`grunt version` to get the code ready for a new release
`grunt watch:test` to watch for changes and test
`grunt watch:build` to watch for changes and build

Please don't add changes to the `dist/` folder in your pull request. It's only updated when releasing a new version.

Releasing
Releasing a new version is mostly done by itself. However, you need to manually update the CHANGELOG. Follow these steps and use semantic versioning for new versions:
- `npm version <newversion> -m "Releasing %s"`
- `npm publish`

Running Examples
You can manually test using the included examples.
To run examples in a browser, use `$ npm run examples` and open `127.0.0.1:3000`.
To start the sandbox in a browser, use `$ npm start` and open `127.0.0.1:3000`.
To run the sandbox in the terminal, use `$ npm start` and then `$ node ./sandbox/client`.
