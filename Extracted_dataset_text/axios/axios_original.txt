Developing
grunt test run the jasmine and mocha tests grunt build run webpack and bundle the source grunt version prepare the code for release grunt watch:test watch for changes and run test grunt watch:build watch for changes and run build
Please don't include changes to dist/ in your pull request. This should only be updated when releasing a new version.
Releasing
Releasing a new version is mostly automated. For now the CHANGELOG requires being updated manually. Once this has been done run the commands below. Versions should follow semantic versioning.
npm version <newversion> -m "Releasing %s"
npm publish
