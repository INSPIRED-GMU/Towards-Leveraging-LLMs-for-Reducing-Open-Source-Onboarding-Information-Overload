Contributing to Angular 

Welcome! We'd love your help making Angular even better.  Here's how you can get involved.

How to Be a Great Contributor:

Follow the Code of Conduct:** Keep things friendly and respectful.
Got a question?** Ask on Stack Overflow (tag: angular) instead of opening an issue. It's a better place for general questions because:
     Many people can help!
    Answers are public to benefit others.
    Voting helps the best answers rise to the top.
Found a bug? Report it with a minimal reproduction (reduced test case) in an issue on our GitHub repository.
Want a new feature?
Request it in a GitHub issue.  For major features, discuss it first to avoid duplicate work. 

Submitting Issues and Pull Requests (PRs):

Search first! Someone may have already reported your issue.
Include a minimal reproduction** for bugs so we can fix them quickly.
Use the new issue templates** when creating issues.
PRs: Before submitting:
   	 Search GitHub for existing PRs on the same topic.
    Make sure an issue describes your fix or documents the feature.
    Sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
    Fork the angular/angular repo.
    Make your changes in a new branch.
    Include appropriate tests and follow coding rules.
    Run all Angular tests and ensure they pass.
    Use clear commit messages following our conventions.

After Your Pull Request is Merged**

Reviewers may ask for changes. Make the updates, re-run tests, and push a fixup commit.
You can then safely delete your branch.

Code & Commit Message Guidelines**

All changes must have tests.
Public API methods need documentation.
Follow Google's JavaScript Style Guide with a 100-character line wrap.
We have specific rules for formatting commit messages for readability. 

Signing the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Everyone who contributes code must sign the CLA. It's a quick process!
