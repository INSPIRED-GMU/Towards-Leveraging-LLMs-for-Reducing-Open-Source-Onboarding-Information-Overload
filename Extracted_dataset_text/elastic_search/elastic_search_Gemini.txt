Here's a simplified version of the text about contributing to Elasticsearch:

How to Contribute

Elasticsearch welcomes contributions from the community! There are many ways to help, including:

Writing tutorials or blog posts
Improving the documentation
Reporting bugs
Suggesting new features
Writing code

Reporting Bugs

Make sure you're testing against the latest version of Elasticsearch.
Search for similar issues on GitHub before reporting a new one.
If possible, provide a small test case that reproduces the bug.
Include as much detail as possible about the problem.

Suggesting Features

Describe the feature you'd like to see and why it's useful.
Explain how you think it should work.
Search for existing issues on GitHub that discuss similar features.

Contributing Code

Discuss your idea on GitHub first. 
Follow the coding guidelines (see below).
Submit a pull request with your changes.

Coding Guidelines

Use clear and concise variable and method names.
Write Javadoc comments for new code.
Follow formatting guidelines (e.g., 4-space indentation, 140-character line width).
Make sure your code compiles and passes tests.

Getting Started

You'll need Java 17 and Git installed.
 Fork the Elasticsearch repository on GitHub.
Follow the instructions for building and testing the code.

## Building Elasticsearch: A Simpler Guide

This guide explains how to build and test changes to Elasticsearch code. 

Before you start:

Make sure you have Java 17 and Git installed on your computer.

Building the code:**

1. Navigate to the root directory of the Elasticsearch project:
 
   cd elasticsearch/
 
2. Building a specific distribution:
	For a macOS tar archive, run:
   	./gradlew -p distribution/archives/darwin-tar assemble
  	You'll find the archive under:
    	./distribution/archives/darwin-tar/build/distributions/
    
 To build all distributions (plugins, Javadocs, etc.), run:
  ./gradlew assemble
  
    Note:This requires Docker to be installed.

The built package distributions (Debian, RPM) and archive distributions (tar, zip) can be found in their respective directories under: distribution/archives/(...) OR distribution/packages/(...)


Running the tests:

Before submitting your code changes, run the entire test suite to check everything works as expected:

   ./gradlew check

If your changes only affect the documentation, run:

   ./gradlew -p docs check


Project layout:

The project is organized into folders. Here's a quick overview of the important ones:

docs: Contains all project documentation.
distribution:** Builds the different distributions (packages, archives) of Elasticsearch.
libs: Internal libraries used by other parts of the project (not for general use).
modules: Features included with Elasticsearch by default, but separate from the main server.
plugins: Officially supported plugins that add extra features to Elasticsearch.
qa: Contains various tests for Elasticsearch, including tests that require multiple modules or plugins.
server: The core server component of Elasticsearch. 
test: Contains the test framework and test fixtures used to test all parts of Elasticsearch.
x-pack: Commercially licensed code that integrates with Elasticsearch.

Contributing your code:

Elasticsearch welcomes contributions! Before submitting your code, please discuss your changes in a GitHub issue first. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and ensures your contribution aligns with the project's needs.
Remember:

Follow the coding guidelines provided by the project.
Include tests that verify your code changes work correctly.
Respond to any review comments promptly.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to Elasticsearch!
