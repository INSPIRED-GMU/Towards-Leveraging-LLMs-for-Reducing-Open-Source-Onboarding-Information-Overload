Code Contributions
Want to add code to Markdown Here? Here's what you need to do:

1. Agree to the rules:Before you can submit your code changes (called a pull request), you'll need to agree to follow the project's rules. There are two versions, one for individuals and another for companies. You can find them on the project page on GitHub(link).
2. Sign the agreement: When you submit your code changes, create a new file in the pull request. Name it like this: `/contributors/{your_github_username}.md`. In that file, write that you agree to the rules. There's an example you can copy from the project owner's agreement file (link).
