Helping with Bootstrap
Want to help improve Bootstrap? Here’s what you need to know.
Before You Start
Please read this guide carefully to make helping out as straightforward as possible for everyone. Following these guidelines shows respect for the time of the developers working on this project. They, in turn, will show respect for your input by considering your issues and suggestions.
Using the Issue Tracker
The issue tracker is for bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Please respect these rules:
For personal support questions, use Stack Overflow (bootstrap-5 tag), Slack, or IRC instead of the issue tracker.
 Keep discussions on topic and be respectful of others' opinions.
 Don’t just comment “+1” or “:thumbsup:”. Use GitHub's reactions feature instead. Off-topic comments may be deleted.
Don’t open issues for questions or feedback about official themes from (link). 
Email them to themes AT getbootstrap DOT com.

Check if the issue has already been reported or fixed.
Isolate the problem. Create a reduced test case and a live example if possible.
Include detailed information: What steps will reproduce the issue? What browser and OS are affected? What would you expect to happen?
