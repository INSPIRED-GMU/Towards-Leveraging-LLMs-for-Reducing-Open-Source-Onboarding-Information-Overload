Helping Bootstrap

Welcome! This guide will help you contribute to Bootstrap. Please read it carefully to make things smooth for everyone.
Being Nice
This guide helps developers respect each other's time. 
Be polite when asking for help or submitting something.
Using the Issue Tracker
 	Report bugs and request features here, but follow the rules:
	No help requests - use Stack Overflow or chat instead.
    	Stay on topic and be respectful.
    	Don't use "+1" or "thumbsup" comments, use GitHub reactions.
    	Issues with official themes should be emailed to [email address removed].

Understanding Labels

We use labels to organize issues. Here's what they mean:
browser bug - a bug caused by the browser, not Bootstrap.
 confirmed - a real bug in Bootstrap.
 css, js - problems with Bootstrap's code.
docs - improvements needed for the documentation.
examples - issues with the example templates.
feature - a request for a new feature.
 and more... (see the project labels page for all of them)

Bug Reports

Make sure your problem isn't caused by your own code first.
Search for existing issues before reporting a new one.
Try to fix the problem yourself if you can. 
If you report a bug, be detailed:
What device and browser are you using?
What steps cause the bug?
Can you share code that shows the bug?

New Features
New features might require a new version of Bootstrap. 
Make a good case for why your feature is important.

Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to contribute fixes or improvements.
Keep your pull requests focused on one thing.
Talk to the developers before working on a big pull request.
Follow the coding guidelines (like using spaces instead of tabs).
Don't change some specific files (Bootstrap will handle those).
Make your changes in separate files for code and documentation.
Follow the steps to submit a pull request.

Code Guidelines
There are some rules for writing code for Bootstrap (see the Code Guide).
Consider color contrast for people with disabilities.
Don't remove focus styles unless you replace them.
 Use spaces instead of tabs in JavaScript.

Checking Your Code
 Run a test before submitting your code to make sure it follows the guidelines.
