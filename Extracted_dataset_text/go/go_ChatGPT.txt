Helping with Go
Go is a project with input from many people. Weâ€™re thankful for any help you provide!
Before Reporting a Problem
- If you're not sure you've found a bug, please ask on the Go mailing list (link)  or other Go forums first. If it turns out to be a bug, you can then report it in the issue tracker.

Reporting Issues
- For urgent security issues, email them to security@golang.org. Check the security guidelines (link)  for more info.
- The best way to report an issue is by using `go bug`. But if you report an issue another way, please be ready to answer these questions:
  1. Which version of Go are you using (`go version`)?
  2. What computer system and processor type are you using?
  3. What actions did you take?
  4. What did you expect to happen?
  5. What actually happened?
- For suggesting changes, see how to propose changes to Go (link) .

Adding Code
- Please look at the Contribution Guidelines (link)  before submitting code changes.
- Unless mentioned otherwise, Go's source files are shared under a BSD-style license found in the LICENSE file.
